	and Node3D.findAttachment (its rigid models, a sword, a gun, a hat, hang from the character's joint named as the one their file hangs them from,
	keeping their offset, or from a joint the choice names, a socket). The policy is this class's: choices may come before the skeleton, and in

	loads is dropped, and a part that can't be worn leaves its slot empty, saying why. */
