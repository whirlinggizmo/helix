/** A character creator's dressing room: a character on a turntable in a studio's light (a View3D on the stage, the light the room's
	Environment3D), under a UI on the stage (Ui), dressed slot by slot (head, body, legs, feet, and
	what she holds) from Quaternius's Ultimate Modular Women, ten outfits whose parts mix freely. Each slot's parts are tiles, their pictures
	rendered from the parts themselves (render targets) as their files load; a slot's files load only when its tab is opened, through the
	Models the program shares (here the one in the room and the one the pictures are taken of), and an Outfit (this example's, over the
	framework's binding and attachment queries) wears each choice on
	the skeleton by joint name, a held part at a joint. The camera starts on her whole and stays where it's put while she's dressed: drag to turn
	her, the wheel or a pinch to zoom (from close in to well back in the room), a double click or a double tap on her to frame the part under it
	(on a slot's tab, that slot), on the empty room to see her whole again. The turntable turns her slowly, on or off by its toggle or T.
	The Animation dropdown plays any of her animations, every clip in the animations file by a readable name, idles first; a play button
	plays the chosen one again from its start, and Loop says whether it goes on or plays once and goes back to her idle after, her idle the
	one for what she holds (a sword, a gun or nothing); choosing a clip sets Loop to the clip's own way (idles, walks and runs loop) and the
	player may flip it. Random and Reset dress her at once. The hint and status lines sit on dark bands, readable over the lit room. Pointer,
	keys (arrows, Tab, Enter; Q and E change slot) or a pad.

	Options: autopilot (a script under assets/: the turntable, her pose and the camera, on the Body framing, are then held from the first frame,
	the window the autopilot's page's size, so its samples of her and of the tiles' pictures compare across targets). */
