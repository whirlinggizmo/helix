/** A kinematic car on its node, driven by the keys (UP / DOWN or W / S throttle and brake, LEFT / RIGHT or A / D steering) or a pad (the
	left stick steers, the right trigger drives, the left brakes), read from the program's input (Input: the window's, or an autopilot's while it plays). A bicycle model:
	the speed from the throttle's acceleration, drag (the speed settles at topSpeed under full throttle) and the brake, the steering angle
	moving toward the wheel's at a fixed rate and narrowing as the speed grows, the heading turned by speed / wheelbase x tan(angle) and the
	position moved along it. Deterministic (helix.math.Trig for every sine, cosine and tangent), so an autopilot's drive replays alike in
	the browser and natively. It writes the node's position and yaw (y rotation), turns the front wheels (the model's wheel-front-left and
	wheel-front-right, found by name once) to the steering angle and spins all four by the distance over wheelRadius. Nothing keeps it on the
	road. It waits for its race (race, a Race behavior's node) to be racing, and stands still until then. */
