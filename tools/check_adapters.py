"""Checks the adapter rule (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) where it can be checked mechanically:

  1. An adapter (src/helix/adapters/) names no engine code: no rendering, no engine service (the shared Fetch, Storage, ImageDecoding,
     AudioDecoding, InputRouter and job pool among them; their result types are the contracts' and allowed), no generated program
     class, no shared decoder or policy. It implements a platform contract and nothing else.
  2. Engine code (src/helix/ outside adapters/ and profiles/) uses no platform API (js.html, js.Browser, js.Syntax, js.lib, sys., cpp.)
     and no target conditional (#if js, cpp, sys, hl). The build macros (src/helix/macro/) run in the compiler, not on a target, and may
     ask the machine building (helix.macro.Haxelib reads its architecture for hxcpp).
  3. An adapter's C includes no generated shader header: programs reach adapters as data.
  4. Adapters of the same contract don't copy code: no run of DUPLICATE_LINES or more identical (normalized) lines in two adapters of
     one area. A call into an adapter's own extern bridge (its internal/*Bridge) is its own, as it reaches that adapter's C: two thin
     adapters over shared code in adapters/shared/ (the native hosts over NativeHost) differ in what they call. The same logic written
     differently isn't caught here; review is for that.
  5. Each adapter directory (adapters/<contract>/) is named for its contract: some class in it implements I<Contract>, the directory's
     name being the interface's without the I, lowercased.
  6. Each API directory (adapters/<contract>/<api>/) holds the adapter <Api><Contract>Adapter implementing I<Contract>, words the API's
     name ends with and the contract's starts with written once (webaudio + Audio is WebAudioAdapter, haxehttp + Http HaxeHttpAdapter).

Known violations, each with what removes it, would be listed in KNOWN (the audit's list, docs/ADAPTER_AUDIT.md, emptied as its steps
landed); one that has gone must be taken off, so the list only shrinks. Exits 1 on any other violation.
