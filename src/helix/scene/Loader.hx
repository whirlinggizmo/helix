/** A group of loads with one progress: a scene's files gathered so a loading screen shows how far they are (progress, from how many
	have ended) and the scene starts once they're done (done), with what failed by name (failures). Each load goes through the service
	it always did, its own lambdas kept (a failure with no failed lambda logged with its path, as the service would); the loader only counts. wrap
	counts any other load the game makes. Nothing here cancels: a scene that exits early cancels its own requests, and a cancelled load is never
