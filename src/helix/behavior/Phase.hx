/** When in a frame a behavior runs: the Behaviors pass updates every behavior of one phase before any of the next, in this order, and

	it, Simulate, and a subclass has its base's. Fixed and few on purpose: a reader knows what a frame does from the class alone, and
	every target runs it alike (docs/DECISIONS.md 134). */
