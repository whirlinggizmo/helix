/** A retained 3D scene: nodes under a root, drawn by draw(camera) inside a frame. A draw walks the tree as it is now (each world matrix
	worked out only where something changed), gathers the lights it finds, places each model's part's box and culls it against the
	camera's view, sorts the opaque models so alike ones (same mesh and material) are together and the see-through ones back to front after
	them, writes each model's instance record (its matrix's rows, its normals' matrix's rows, its tint), and draws each run of alike models as
	one instanced draw. Lit by its lights and its ambient light, glTF metallic-roughness (Material).

	Shadows: lights that cast them (Light.shadowCasting, up to the four the stage lights by) each draw the models that cast into a layer of
	a shadow map, in drawShadows, which comes before the frame's screen pass (beginFrame) as any pass into a texture does; draw then reads the
	maps the last drawShadows made. A directional light's map is a square over what the camera sees out to its shadow distance, its texels
	the same size and in the same places in the world as the camera moves and turns, so its shadows' edges hold still; a spot's covers its
	cone.

	Environment: an environment map (Environments.load) lights its lit models as well (setEnvironment), diffuse light from all around and
	reflections sharp to blurred by roughness, and can stand behind everything (setBackground). Its lit color, which can run past 1, comes
	into what a screen shows by its exposure and tone mapping (exposure, tonemap: Khronos PBR Neutral at 0 EV to start), or in an HDR
	scene (hdr) past 1 for a PostProcess chain to tone map; its sprites, text and particles are display colors, untouched.

	Surface shaders: a material's (Material.setShader) draws its models, a skinned one through the shader's skinned variant, and casts their
	shadows through its caster where it has one (a vertex hook or a discard), so the shadow moves and opens as the surface does. A model's
	passes (ModelPass: outlines, silhouettes) are drawn from its records after the opaque models. */
