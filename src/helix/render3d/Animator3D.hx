	clip from one file plays on a skeleton from another with the same names, and a clip naming a node the root hasn't is refused. play()
	crossfades from the clip before over the seconds given; a node the clips don't both move blends with its rest pose (where it was when the
	Animator3D first moved it). queue() plays a clip next, when the one playing ends (a one-shot back to its idle). update() advances the time and poses the nodes; a Renderer3D draws them as they're left. One clip plays at a time
