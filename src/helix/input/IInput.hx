/** Keyboard, pointer, mouse buttons, wheel, typed text, touches and gamepads.
	Tick edges (isPressed, isReleased) are counted and survive polling and render frames; consume() after a simulation tick takes one of each,
	so every press is seen by exactly one tick, and two presses between ticks reach two ticks.
	Frame edges (isFramePressed, isFrameReleased), typed text, the wheel and lifted touches last one frame.
	A key is claimed by what reads it first and uses it (claim: the UI's focused text field, a menu): for the rest of the frame it reads as
	up, unpressed and unreleased to everything after, so typing a space in a field doesn't make the player jump. */
