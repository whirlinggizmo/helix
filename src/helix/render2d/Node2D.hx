/** What a Renderer2D holds: a transform in a tree, with children of its own kind. A bare one is a group: it draws nothing, only a transform for
	its children (an empty in Blender, a dummy in 3ds Max, a null in Cinema 4D), a handle that moves or hides a set of things together, or a
	pivot to turn them about. The framework's kinds are its classes (Sprite2D, Shape2D, Text2D, Particles2D), each holding only its own data;
	a game never subclasses one, and game state lives elsewhere, the node its view (docs/DECISIONS.md, 61 and 130). Its transform is a
	position, a rotation in radians (clockwise on screen, y growing down) and a scale, relative to its parent; its world transform is worked
	out when a stage draws it, only after it or a node above it changed. Any node can clip its children (setClip). */
