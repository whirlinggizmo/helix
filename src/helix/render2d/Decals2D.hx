/** Marks left on the ground of a game seen from above: skid marks, footsteps, scorch marks, a target ring. A fixed pool of a texture's
	sprites, drawn together (alike sprites beside each other in the draw order are one draw): each place puts one down, and once the pool is
	full the oldest is taken up and put down again, so a trail never grows past its capacity. Given a life (lifeSeconds), each mark fades out
	over fadeSeconds once it has lived it, on the game's clock (a paused game's marks stay as they are), and is taken up; without one it
	stays until the pool comes round to it. Either way the ones next to be taken up for reuse (fadeCount) fade by how soon, so a full pool's
	trail thins out where it ends instead of losing a mark at a time. In its own space: add it under what walks over the marks (before them,
	as a child drawn first). Decals are never picked: a click passes to what's under them. */
