/** Screen effects over a finished frame: the scene is drawn into a texture the screen's size (beginScene to endScene, a target pass), the
	enabled effects but the last draw in turn from one texture into another (target passes without depth, still before the screen's), and
	present draws the last over the screen's pass, or the frame as it is when no effect is on. Effects run in the order added, so turning one
	off and on (ScreenEffect.enabled) keeps its place. Its textures follow the screen's size; an effect's intermediates
	(ScreenEffect.intermediates) are made at their fractions of it.

	An HDR chain: when an enabled effect wants HDR (ScreenEffect.hdr) and the GPU draws half floats (IGraphics.canRender), the scene is drawn
	in RGBA16F, its stage (stage) writing its light after the exposure with no tone mapping, as sRGB values running past 1 (the sRGB curve
	carried on past 1, so sprites, particles and text, whose colors are sRGB values already, blend into it as into the screen, and are tone
	mapped with it). The tone mapping then runs as an effect (helix.shaders.Tonemap, with the stage's mode), after the last effect wanting HDR, unless the chain
	has one of its own; the effects before it read and write half floats, the ones after it the tone-mapped frame in RGBA8. Without half
	floats every texture is RGBA8 as the screen is, the stage tone maps as it draws, and a Tonemap in the chain is skipped. An HDR scene is
	cleared to what its tone mapping shows as the clear color (Tonemap.computeHdrColor), so a background of clear color alone looks the same
	with the chain HDR or not. */
