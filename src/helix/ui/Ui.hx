/** A screen's widgets on the stage, used by the pointer, keys and pads alike: made here,
	placed by their layouts (Layout2D.arrange), asked what happened. update() once a frame, after the pointer's:

	- Arrows and a pad's D-pad move focus to the nearest widget that way on screen (by the layouts' last arrangement: a grid of tiles moves in
	  two dimensions), or, with none that way, in the order widgets were made: Down and Right to the next, Up and Left to the one before,
	  wrapping; Left and Right only when the focused widget doesn't use them (a slider), Up and Down only when it doesn't (a list; a color
	  picker uses all four while one of its parts is driven by them). Tab and Shift+Tab always go in that order. Enter, Space or a pad's South activates it; Escape or East is back (backPressed).
	- The ring around the focused widget shows only when keys or a pad moved focus, not the pointer (as the web's :focus-visible); after keys or
	  a pad, something always has focus (the first widget, if nothing did).
	- A key or button already held when a screen begins (reset) does nothing until it's let go: a fire key held into a menu doesn't press its
	  first button.
	- While a widget has the keys (capturingKeys), a game should leave arrows and Enter be, or they drive the game and the menu at once.
	- A widget may open a popup (Popup: a dropdown's list), drawn over every widget and the ring and clipped by none of their clips, placed by
	  its anchor in the visible area (below it, or above when there's no room below and more above; kept on screen across). While it's open
	  (popup) it has the pointer and the keys: the widgets under it see no pointer, a press off it closes it and does nothing else until it's
	  let go (not even reaching a world under the UI: the pointer is captured), Escape or East closes it instead of going back (backPressed
	  stays false), Tab doesn't move focus, and its owner keeps focus and takes the arrows, Enter, Space and South (capturingKeys is true).

	The widgets' nodes are under one node (root) on the stage, in the order made, the ring above them and the open popup above it: what's
	added to the stage after it draws over it. */
