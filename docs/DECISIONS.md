# Decisions

Why things are the way they are, numbered, in order.

1. **A library above the platform starts as its API, not a prose spec.** Its types and members with their doc comments are written
   first, agreed and tried before any implementation, and the doc comments are its spec. A prose spec says again what the doc comments
   say, and drifts from them: `IFileSystem`'s comments still said a page's root could be the server after docs/PLATFORM.md said
   otherwise, and two of the build trial's agents went looking for that file system. The same trial built every adapter right from the
   reference, the READMEs and the examples alone, with no spec.
2. **Each service is constructed on its own,** from the contracts it needs, as the platform's adapters are: no hub holding all six. A
   program carries only what it constructs. Both Opus agents of the build trial's second run did this; the Sonnet agent built a hub
   and said one each would fit better.
3. **An input action is named by a string:** `input.bind("jump", [...])`, `input.pressed("jump")`. Names are what a settings file or a
   rebinding screen holds.
4. **Assets keeps its own cache on both targets,** IndexedDB in a page and the cache directory natively, with cache modes (revalidate by
   the host's Cache-Control, trust the copy, off) and manifests. The browser's HTTP cache gives revalidation alone, may evict a large
   file between runs, and would make a page behave apart from native; HeliX's assets found every mode necessary.
5. **A sound loads two ways:** decoded whole (`load`, for effects) or played as it's read (`stream`, for music), as HeliX had them.
6. **Saves writes at its poll:** `set` queues a change, and the next `poll` writes everything set that frame as one file, one write in
   flight at a time; `flush(done, failed)` starts the pending write at once, never blocking. A page's end (`IWindow.onClose`, at
   pagehide) can start a write that never finishes, so little is left pending for it.
