## App

*class* in [`src/helix/App.hx`](../../src/helix/App.hx), `import helix.App;`

HeliX's entry point. A game is a class extending it, overriding init, update and cleanup, and its Main is `new Game()`: the constructor starts HeliX, picking the profile by the backend the build names (`-D helix-backend=webgl2`, `sokol-gl`, `sdl3-gl` or `sdl3-gpu`; a build naming none fails, naming the choices), so one Main serves every target: `class Game extends helix.App { override public function init():Void {...} override public function update(dt:Float):Void {...} }` (init once, the services bound: Window, Input, Graphics and the others; update once a display refresh, the game's logic), and `class Main { static function main() new Game(); }`. The drawing is the runner's: after update it draws the Stage (helix.render2d.Stage), what the game put on it (docs/DISPLAY_MODEL.md). The object exists before HeliX does: a field initializer runs before the services are bound, so what needs them (a Batch2D, a texture) is made in init. Natively the constructor returns only when the window closes. Options (AppOptions: the identity, where the assets are, a manifest, the window, the development extras) are given to the constructor, `super(options)` or `new Game(options)`. Hot reload: the Runner reaches the app only through `@:hot` static functions (hot statics) that helix.macro.AppBuild writes into the game's class (`hotApp`, the object; `hotInit`, `hotFrame`, `hotCleanup`), so a native reload re-points its calls and migrates the object (hotreload-hx: the main class is compiled once and never reloaded, and a call from code compiled before a reload reaches new code only through a `@:hot` static function); in the browser old classes forward, so it costs nothing. The game class is therefore not Main, which hotreload-hx never reloads and refuses `@:hot` in.

```haxe
function new(?options:AppOptions)
var options(default, null):AppOptions
function init():Void
function update(dt:Float):Void
function cleanup():Void
```

- `new`: Starts HeliX with this app, with options (the defaults when not given): the profile of the build's backend runs, binds the services, calls init once the game's config.json (if any) has come, then update once a display refresh, and cleanup when the window closes (the page goes away). Throws for an identity (product, company) that isn't a file name. Natively returns when the window has closed.
- `options`: The options it started with.
- `init`: Once, before the first frame, with the app's services bound (Window, Input, Graphics and the others). Nothing by default.
- `update`: Once a display refresh, before the frame is drawn: the game's logic. dt is the measured seconds since the last frame, held between 1e-6 and 0.1, and 1/60 on the first: for animation. A fixed-rate simulation takes Time.frameElapsed instead (helix.host.FrameClock). Nothing by default.
- `cleanup`: Once, when the window closes (on the web, at the page's pagehide). Nothing by default.

## AppOptions

*class* in [`src/helix/AppOptions.hx`](../../src/helix/AppOptions.hx), `import helix.AppOptions;`

What an App starts with, given to its constructor (`super(options)`, or `new Game(options)` from Main); the defaults when none is given. Read once, as the app starts: a change after is too late.

```haxe
function new()
var product:String
var company:String
var assets:Null<String>
var manifest:Null<String>
var window:WindowOptions
var devKeys:Bool
var pageState:Bool
var pauseOnBlur:Bool
```

- `new`: The defaults: product "Game" by "DefaultCompany", the assets beside the program, no manifest, a window of 4 samples a pixel, and the development extras on in a debug build (-debug) and off otherwise.
- `product`: The program's own name: with company, its identity (helix.host.Identity), which names what HeliX keeps for it (its cache directory natively, its cache database in the browser, its screenshots' directory). One safe file name; cleaned as Identity cleans it.
- `company`: The company, the other half of the identity.
- `assets`: Where the assets are: in the browser the URL the asset paths are fetched under ("assets/", beside the page, by default), natively a directory relative to the program's ("assets", beside it, by default). Null for the platform's default.
- `manifest`: A manifest among the assets (tools/gen_manifest.py; "manifest.json" for the examples), read in the browser so a returning page re-fetches only what changed; null (the default) fetches each file as it's asked for. Natively a manifest comes from HELIX_ASSET_MANIFEST instead, with HELIX_ASSET_HOST.
- `window`: The window as it opens: the multisampling samples a pixel.
- `devKeys`: The development keys around every frame: F9 saves a screenshot of the frame (a download in a browser, a file in the user's pictures natively), logged where it went. On in a debug build (-debug), off otherwise, unless set. A game chooses its own keys for what it ships.
- `pageState`: Whether the page is told the program's state, for the tools driving it: in a browser, window.helixBusy says after each frame whether the services are still loading (Host.busy), and false once the program has quit, so a tool captures the page once it has settled (tools/pages_shots.cjs); natively nothing. On in a debug build (-debug), off otherwise, unless set.
- `pauseOnBlur`: Whether the game's clock (Time.clock) pauses while the window doesn't have the focus, and goes on when it's back: a game left in another tab or behind another window waits. On unless set off; a clock the game paused itself stays paused either way.
