## Autopilot

*class* in [`src/helix/debug/Autopilot.hx`](../../src/helix/debug/Autopilot.hx), `import helix.debug.Autopilot;`

Bounded JSON commands produce normal input, a tick at a time; probes (named values) are supplied by the app. A script replays alike on every target when it keeps two rules: - It waits on state, never on time, for anything that isn't the simulation's (a load, a menu, a screen appearing): `wait` on a probe, its limit in seconds (`"seconds"`); tick counts (`"timeout"`, `hold`) only for what the simulation itself does, once a wait has found it running. - The game starts each replayed phase from a known state when it begins: play starting fresh from the seed (a new level), however late it starts; a title screen's motion is dressing, not part of the game. Then a menu, a slow load or a frame's timing can delay a start without the game differing. A `sample` reads the frame's pixels at points and puts them in snapshot's samples under its name, which tools/example.py compares between the browser and native: `{"op": "sample", "name": "lit", "points": [[x, y], ...]}`, the points in the design's units (Screen's), 1 to 64 of them; `"tolerance"`, how far each channel (0 to 255) may differ across targets, 3 when not given; and `"differsFrom"` with `"by"`, an earlier sample's name and an amount, failing the script unless every point differs from the same point there by at least that much in some channel (an effect turned on against it off, so a shader drawing nothing fails); and `"matches"` with `"within"`, an earlier sample's name and an amount, failing it unless every point is within that much of the same point there in every channel (what must look the same either way, as a background with an HDR chain and without). The frame read is the one drawn after the ticks before it: while it waits for that frame to end, awaitingFrame is true and the app runs no tick. A `drag` is the pointer held down at one point and moved to another: `{"op": "drag", "from": [x, y], "to": [x, y], "ticks": n}`, the points in the design's units (Screen's; as given without a runner, in a test), pressed at from on its first tick, moved a straight line to reach to after n more, and let go there on the tick after. A `type` is text typed on one tick, as a keyboard's characters arrive (dropped, as theirs are, while nothing has asked for text entry: focus a text field first): `{"op": "type", "text": "ff8800"}`. Any point (a sample's, a drag's) may instead be a widget's: `{"target": "background", "part": "hue", "at": [.3, .5]}`, at fractions of the rectangle of the UI's widget named target, or of its part named part (Ui.computePoint lists them: a slider's track, a color picker's square and bars, a scrollbar's thumb, a list's rows ...), 0, 0 its top left and 1, 1 its bottom right, outside it past them. So a script keeps working when padding, gaps or a widget's size move the layout. Each is found where the widget was last drawn when the point is used: a sample's as it asks for its frame; a drag's from as it presses, its to again every tick. One not found (no such widget shown, or no such part now) is waited for, as a click waits, within the command's "seconds" (5 when not given), and fails the script after. A `click` with `"at"` (and `"part"`) presses and lets go of the pointer there instead of using the widget by name. With a program's input bound (under the runner), while it plays, that input (Input) is the script's: a Ui, a pointer looking at the stage and the screens that run themselves (Splash, Loading, a Transition) play it as they read Input, with nothing handed to them; the program's own input is back once every command has finished.

```haxe
function new(json:String, ?screenshot:Null<String> -> Void, ?press:String -> Bool, ?sample:(points:Array<Array<Float>>, done:Array<Array<Int>> -> Void, failed:String -> Void) -> Void, ?locate:(target:String, part:String, x:Float, y:Float, out:Array<Float>) -> Bool)
var done(default, null):Bool
var tickCount(get, never):Int
var input(get, never):IInput
var seed(default, null):Int
var outcomes(default, null):Array<Dynamic>
var awaitingFrame(default, null):Bool
function advance(probe:String -> Dynamic):IInput
var snapshot(get, never):Dynamic
```

- `new`: Checks a whole script ({version: 1, seed, commands}: press, hold, wait, assert, click, screenshot, sample, drag, type; at most 128) and throws on anything invalid or unknown. A wait has one limit: "timeout" in ticks, or "seconds" of the clock. A click uses a UI's widget by name, waiting (as a web suite's actions do) until press, the app's (Ui.press, say), finds it shown and usable, within its limit; without press it fails; one with "at" (and "part") clicks the pointer at that point of the widget instead, waiting until it's found. A screenshot command calls screenshot with its name (null for the default name; Screenshots.take, say), or does nothing without one. A sample calls sample with its points (Screenshots.sample, say), which calls done with each point's color as [r, g, b, a], 0 to 255, once the frame has ended, or failed; without sample it fails. A point naming a widget asks locate (Ui.computePoint, say) for the framebuffer pixel at its fractions of the widget's or its part's rectangle (written to out; as given without a runner, in a test), waiting while it answers false; without locate it fails.
- `done`: Whether every command has finished.
- `tickCount`: Ticks the commands have run so far.
- `input`: The input the script plays, the one advance returns: the same object for the whole script, so what reads it (a UI, an Actions map) can be given it before the first tick.
- `seed`: The script's seed, 1 to 2147483647, for the app's random numbers.
- `outcomes`: One record a finished command: its index, op, the tick it finished on and the probe's value.
- `awaitingFrame`: Whether a sample waits for the frame being drawn to end: the input advance returned isn't to be played, and the app runs no tick this frame (its tick loop stops when this is true, as it does when done).
- `advance`: Once a tick: runs commands until one needs this tick, asking probe for named values, and returns the input to play it with. Throws when a wait times out or an assert fails.
- `snapshot`: Progress as a record: completed, ticks, the current command index, the outcomes and the samples (by name: points, colors as [r, g, b, a] and tolerance).

## FpsOverlay

*class* in [`src/helix/debug/FpsOverlay.hx`](../../src/helix/debug/FpsOverlay.hx), `import helix.debug.FpsOverlay;`

The frame rate and the frame's cost, averaged over half a second, as a node (docs/DISPLAY_MODEL.md): put it on the stage where it should show (its top-left at its position, in the stage's units), and update it each frame; it draws its line again when the numbers change.

```haxe
function new(?size:Float = 16., ?color:Int = 0xff7fe07f)
var size:Float
var color:Int
var frameRate(get, never):Float
var frameMs(get, never):Float
function update(dt:Float, cpu:Float):Void
```

- `new`: An overlay showing 0 until half a second of frames has been seen, size tall (16 unless given) in color (0xAARRGGBB, a light green unless given).
- `size`: The glyph height, in the stage's units.
- `color`: Its color, 0xAARRGGBB.
- `frameRate`: Frames a second over the last half second.
- `frameMs`: The frame's average cost in milliseconds over the last half second.
- `update`: dt: the frame's interval; cpu: what the frame cost, in milliseconds (Time.frameCpu).

## PickOverlay2D

*class* in [`src/helix/debug/PickOverlay2D.hx`](../../src/helix/debug/PickOverlay2D.hx), `import helix.debug.PickOverlay2D;`

What picks test and what drawing culls by, drawn over a 2D tree for finding why a click misses: add it to the tree to look at (on the stage, or in the tree a View2D shows) last, so it's over the rest, at its origin, unturned and unscaled. Each frame it draws every shown node's own box, square to the tree, as computeBounds measures it and drawing culls by it (boundsColor), and for each node a pick can hit, what the pick tests (hitColor): its hitArea, or its kind's own shape (a sprite's or text's rectangle, a circle's disc or ring, a line's or outline's stroke, a polygon's inside, a drawing's extent and texts). Nothing is drawn for what a pick doesn't test (a group without a hit area, an emitter; a view picks inside the tree it shows, which an overlay of its own shows). The flags hold as for a pick: a hidden node and everything under it are left out, an unpickable one's gets no pick shape. A clipping node's clip, which also limits a pick, isn't drawn. Never picked.

```haxe
function new(?hitColor:Int = 0xff33ff66, ?boundsColor:Int = 0xffffa020, ?lineWidth:Float = 1.)
var pickShapes:Bool
var drawBounds:Bool
var hitColor:Int
var boundsColor:Int
var lineWidth:Float
```

- `new`: An overlay drawing hit shapes in hitColor (green unless given) and boxes in boundsColor (orange unless given), lineWidth wide (1 unless given), in the tree's units.
- `pickShapes`: Whether it draws what a pick tests on each node it can hit. On to start.
- `drawBounds`: Whether it draws each shown node's own box, square to the tree (an AABB: what drawing culls by). On to start.
- `hitColor`: The color of what each node is hit by, 0xAARRGGBB.
- `boundsColor`: The color of each node's box, 0xAARRGGBB.
- `lineWidth`: How wide its lines are, in the tree's units.

## PickOverlay3D

*class* in [`src/helix/debug/PickOverlay3D.hx`](../../src/helix/debug/PickOverlay3D.hx), `import helix.debug.PickOverlay3D;`

What picks test and what drawing culls by, drawn in a 3D tree for finding why a click misses: add it to the tree to look at (the one a View3D shows) at its origin, unturned and unscaled. Each frame it draws every shown node's box, square to the world, as computeBounds measures it and drawing culls by it (boundsColor), and for each node a pick can hit, what the pick tests (hitColor): its hitArea, a sprite's or text's quad as it faces the camera now, a model's triangles as posed (but for parts too see-through to hit). Nothing is drawn for what a pick doesn't test. The flags hold as for a pick: a hidden node and everything under it are left out, an unpickable one's gets no pick shape. Depth-tested as any drawing, so what's inside a model is hidden by it. Never picked.

```haxe
function new(?hitColor:Int = 0xff33ff66, ?boundsColor:Int = 0xffffa020)
var pickShapes:Bool
var drawBounds:Bool
var hitColor:Int
var boundsColor:Int
```

- `new`: An overlay drawing hit shapes in hitColor (green unless given) and boxes in boundsColor (orange unless given).
- `pickShapes`: Whether it draws what a pick tests on each node it can hit. On to start.
- `drawBounds`: Whether it draws each shown node's own box, square to the world (an AABB: Node3D.computeBounds's, what drawing culls by). On to start.
- `hitColor`: The color of what each node is hit by, 0xAARRGGBB.
- `boundsColor`: The color of each node's box, 0xAARRGGBB.

## TestHarness

*class* in [`src/helix/debug/TestHarness.hx`](../../src/helix/debug/TestHarness.hx), `import helix.debug.TestHarness;`

Where results go for the check that launched the program (an autopilot's final state, a test's checks). The program's one, a static class: each member forwards to instance, written by helix.macro.Facade from ITestHarness's public members with their doc comments.

```haxe
static function publish(value:Dynamic):Void
```

- `publish`: Hands value (JSON-able) to the check: window.result in a browser; natively a JSON line on stdout, also written to the file HELIX_RESULT names.
